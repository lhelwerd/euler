# Euler

This repository contains some Python modules that implement algorithms for 
number theory and other fields of mathematics, but also some file processing 
methods. Potential applications that these modules could be used for are 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems and [Advent of 
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

The modules are written for Python 2 and Python 3; support for Python 2 is 
however legacy as this repository was extracted from an old version meant to 
support running these modules on both versions, because it was implemented back 
when [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) was starting to support Python 3 code.
