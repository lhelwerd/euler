# Release notes

This is an overview of new features and bug fixes made to the Euler module. 
Versions are listed in reverse chronological order, likewise for changes 
(date/time of commit or merge).

## v0.0.2

- Properly determine when to use miller test for totient function and raise 
  error if primes are exhausted
- Correct formula set sometimes trying to adding certain values during 
  expansion when it is not needed
- Formula set off by one errors from extending get items and updates
- Palindrome did not generate some with low limits
- Mark as typed package
- Module is now Python 3.8+ only

## v0.0.1

- Initial release of package
- Modular multiplicative inverse
- Tree-based coprime set generation
- Improve palindrome functions: Correct when limit is an odd-power of ten 
  (i.e., 1000 = 1e3)
- Add length to formula set
- Add range to prime set
- Improve prime set extension
- Correct prime factorization algorithm: E.g., for n=144, the remaining factor 
  was missed as it was both the divisor and the remaining value.
- PrimeSet always reversible
- Proper divisors from prime factorization
- Include Miller test for primality
- Allow Miller test for prime set extension
- Miller-aware totient function with formula speedups
- Totient function based on prime set
- Functions for converting Roman numerals
- Convergents of continued fractions
- Support slices in formula set
- Prime set length and index lookup
- Ensure sorted order in the prime set and formula set
- Prime factorization
- Sequences of numbers generated by a formula
- Text file reading
- Replace Sieve with PrimeSet
- Digit palindrome generation and check
- Proper divisors
- Triangle file reading and maximum path sum
- Initial Sieve module
